## Overview

Vim is a terminal-based text editor specially tailored to programming. It is
best known for its unique keyboard shortcuts and editing style.

There are generally [two choices][editor-war] when it comes to terminal-based
text editors. You are free to choose whatever text editor you prefer, but
because the course staff uses Vim exclusively and teaching two text editors is
counter-productive, this course will focus only on Vim.
