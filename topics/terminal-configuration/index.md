# Terminal Configuration
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

## Overview

Unconfigured, the terminal is a pretty terrible place. It's hard to work in,
it's unforgiving, and in many ways it has a terrible user interface. With a
little bit of effort, you can transform these offenses into the perfect
workplace, a true model of efficiency. With a well-configured terminal, you're
much more likely to actually enjoy sitting at the command prompt.

"Terminal Configuration" is a very broad category, and indeed we've already
covered pieces of it in other places. You use bash to configure bash, Vim for
Vim, etc. Obviously, to learn about the specifics of these technologies you
should see the lessons in their respective topics. The purpose of this "Terminal
Configuration" topic is to pull together the loose ends, offer some special
tips, and discuss the logistics of it all.
