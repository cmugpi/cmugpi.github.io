# Collab Instructions

There are 2 parts to this lab! Make sure to do both and submit your
andrewid-githubid information for grading! 

The first part of the lab should be submitted to Autolab:

- [ColLab](https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/07131q-s22/assessments/collab)

The second part will use GitHub.
For the second part of this assignment, you will get practice with
forking a GitHub repo and making a pull request. The repo you will be
working with is the [git-practice][git-practice] repo. Do the
following:

- Submit your GitHub username on [piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ky1arjp9ogx68y)
- Sign in to your Github account and visit <https://github.com/cmugpi/git-practice>.
- Fork the git-practice repo.
- Clone your fork of the git-practice repo.
- On a new branch (named what you want), edit the files of the repo so that you
  fill in an appetizer, main course, and dessert.
- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
- Make a pull request to cmugpi's git-practice repo. For the title of your pull
  request, put your Andrew ID.
