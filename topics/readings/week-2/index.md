## GPI Vim Config

If you still haven't gone through the Initial Setup instructions, make sure
you do them now.

If you have already done this, you do not have to repeat the process.

- [Initial Setup]

## Reading

Vim is a command line text editor. You may have started using it in your classes
to complete programming assignments.

- `vimtutor`
  - This isn't a reading, it's an interactive tutorial
  - To start, log into Andrew and run the command `vimtutor`
  - Do lessons 1.1 - 2.7
- [Vim as Language]
  - This is a short reading that explains the best way to "think" when using
    Vim.

## Lab

The lab can be found on Autolab:

- [SportsLab](https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/15131-f17/assessments/sportslab)

You will also find this useful for solving the labs (you don't have to
read this before class if you don't want to):

- [Editing & Navigation]
- [Vim Cheatsheet]
