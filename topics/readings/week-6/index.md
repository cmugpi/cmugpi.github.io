## Reading

- [Git Command Overview][git-commands]
- [Using Git on GitHub][using-github]

## Lab

This week's homework has two parts. The first part is on Autolab:

- [ColLab](https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/07131-f20/assessments/collab)

The second part will use GitHub.

For the second part of this assignment, you will get practice with forking a
GitHub repo and making a pull request. The repo you will be working with is the
[git-practice] repo. Do the following:

- Submit your GitHub username to [this](https://forms.gle/k8Wtg9Dfy5Rw6cQx6) form
- Sign in to your Github account and visit
  <https://github.com/cmugpi/git-practice>.
- Fork the git-practice repo.
- Clone your fork of the git-practice repo.
- On a new branch (named what you want), edit the files of the repo so that you
  fill in an appetizer, main course, and dessert.
- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
- Make a pull request to cmugpi's git-practice repo. For the title of your pull
  request, put your Andrew ID.
