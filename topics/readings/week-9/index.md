## Reading

The reading for this week is a bit of a mixup of topics. We want to make sure
everyone understands when to use regex and when to use globs, since they are
similar but used in different contexts.

- [Globbing & Ranges]
- [Regular Expressions]

## Lab

The lab for this week is on regex and globs. You can find it on autolab.

- [Haunt Lab](https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/07131-f19/assessments/hauntlab)
