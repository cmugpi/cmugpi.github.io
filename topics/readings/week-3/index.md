## Reading

- `vimtutor`
  - Same as last week: run `vimtutor` from Andrew
  - Complete lesson 3 onwards
  - There's a lot of stuff here, remember that memorization is not the goal!

## Lab

You will also find this useful for solving the labs (you don't have to
read this before class if you don't want to):

- [Vim Cheatsheet]

[Vim Cheatsheet]: {{ "/topics/vim/vim-cheatsheet.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
