## GPI Vim Config

## Reading

Vim is a command line text editor. You may have started using it in your classes
to complete programming assignments.

- `vimtutor`
  - This isn't a reading, it's an interactive tutorial
  - To start, log into Andrew and run the command `vimtutor`
  - Do lessons 1.1 - 2.7
- [Vim as Language]
  - This is a short reading that explains the best way to "think" when using
    Vim.


## Lab

The lab can be found on Autolab:

You will also find this useful for solving the labs (you don't have to
read this before class if you don't want to):

- [Editing & Navigation]
- [Vim Cheatsheet]
