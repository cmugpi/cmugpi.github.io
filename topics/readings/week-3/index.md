## Reading

- `vimtutor`
  - Same as last week: run `vimtutor` from Andrew
  - Complete lesson 3 onwards
  - There's a lot of stuff here, remember that memorization is not the goal!

## Lab

The lab can be found on Autolab:

- [WizardLab](https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/07131-f18/assessments/wizardlab)

You will also find this useful for solving the labs (you don't have to
read this before class if you don't want to):

- [Searching, Substituting, Text Objects, and Yanking][notes]
- [Vim Cheatsheet]

## Slides
