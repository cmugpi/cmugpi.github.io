The initial version of the course and a significant amount of the current course
content was created [Adam Blank][adam] in Fall 2011. Later, modifications and
additions to the content were made by Josh Zimmerman, who reformatted the
original PDFs into web content.

The current version of the site, including the site layout and design as well as
further modifications and additions to content, was written by [Jake
Zimmerman][jake] with contributions from the GPI staff.

generation and Semantic UI as a general purpose CSS framework. If you enjoyed
