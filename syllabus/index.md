# Syllabus
{:.ui.dividing.header.no_toc}

## Overview

The purpose of GPI is to teach you all kinds of cool things you never knew you
could do with a computer, and make you super comfortable with using the Unix
systems used in 15-122, 15-150, 15-213, and many other CS courses. Our goal for the
course is for you to have a fun break from your other classes, and an
opportunity to see some real uses for what you are learning about.

We will meet on Mondays from 2:30pm to 3:45pm.

## Lecture

The first 20 minutes of class will be a lecture on the week's topic.

Once the lecture is done, you will have time to work on that week's lab while
the instructors are available to help.

## Labs

Labs are composed of terminal/Unix puzzles involving running the right commands
at the prompt or writing a simple script.

This is a 2 unit course. We design the labs to be short, but sometimes they
cannot be completed during lecture. In this case, you will have the remaining
week to finish the lab.

## Late Policy

If you need more time for any reason just ask for an extension. We are fairly
lenient with giving extensions; we would much rather have you complete the
lab and learn than not learn.


## Tests

There will be two in-class written exams with both multiple choice and free
response questions. The second exam will be cumulative.

## Grading

The grading breakdown will be as follows:

- 80% Labs
- 10% Exam 1
- 10% Exam 2

All labs will be weighted equally, so missing one lab is
roughly equivalent to dropping a letter grade.


## Collaboration Policy

On labs, you may...

- use manual (`man`) pages for commands in question.
- use Google to learn how to use a command/solve a problem.
- ask the course staff for help.

Students may point peers to particular commands, but should
refrain from describing a solution to a problem that uses specific commands'
arguments or combinations of commands. The purpose of labs is to learn by
solving. If you solve the lab and then explain the solution to others, they
will not learn!

We will also have a course [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ky1arjp9ogx68y)
where students may ask questions to the course staff and peers.

## Help

If at any point during the semester you are having trouble with anything in the
course or want to know more about a topic, please do not hesitate to email the
course staff or ask one of us in person! We are here to help you and want you to
learn!
